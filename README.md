## Hi, I’m Joost 👋

Data Analyst with 12+ years of experience translating complex, multi-source performance and product data into evidence-based decisions, clear dashboards, and executive-ready insights.

I’ve built and owned analytics and reporting across SaaS, healthcare, and research environments—covering KPI design, funnel and attribution analysis, experimentation support, and decision-focused storytelling. I work end-to-end: define the question, gather and clean data, analyse it, and communicate results so non-technical stakeholders can act.

**Core tools:** SQL, Python (pandas/NumPy), Excel/Sheets, Power BI, Looker Studio, GA4/Matomo, GTM, Git.
